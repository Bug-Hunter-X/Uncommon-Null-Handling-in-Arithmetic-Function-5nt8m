# Uncommon Null Handling in JavaScript Function

This repository demonstrates an uncommon code error in JavaScript related to null handling within an arithmetic function. The function `foo` adds two numbers. However, its handling of null values might not be what is expected in all circumstances.

The `bug.js` file contains the original code, showcasing this behavior. The `bugSolution.js` offers improved and safer approaches to resolve this issue.

## Potential Issues

- **Silent Failure**: Returning 0 when a null value is encountered may mask potential errors. The calling function might not be aware that an operation failed.
- **Unexpected Behavior**: In certain contexts, returning 0 as a result of null input may lead to inaccurate calculations or unexpected program behavior.

## Solutions

Several improved approaches are presented in `bugSolution.js`, making the function more robust and less prone to errors related to null inputs.
